## Unfixed Bugs
- The Ready to go button! disappears when hovering. Unfortunately, it can only be noticed very close to the delivery deadline. This should be fixed in a future code update.
- Falun logo was not loading in the live site version, but it was resolved with a change to the HTML code redirecting the image to be loaded directly from the main directory.
- The form's background image also had the same problem. It was fixed with the same solution as Falun logo.
- On devices with a screen resolution lower than 321x850px, the website presentation shows a white margin on the right. However, nothing was done because few users will use the site under these conditions.
